        """
        Since the feature extraction function is applied to all of the input sources individually and it is not
        (necessarily) desirable to perform classification analysis on features from each stream individually, this
        function allows the features to be extracted, but it does not append these features as outputs. Instead it
        a dictionary of nodes is built up and assigned to the variable endpoints.

        By default this function prepares for aggregating all features into one dictionary which is set as the sole
        output when the 'self.aggregate_outputs(endpoints)' is called. If other endpoints are desired, these can be
        specified with the feats variable, as described in its docstring.


        Parameters
        ----------
        endpoints : defaultdict(dict)
        key
        func
        kwargs : None, or list(tuple(str))
            This defines the types of outputs that the user can define to be outputted. If all features that
            arose from the accelerometer on the wrist should be aggregated, feats should be specified as:
            ```python
            feats = [('accel', 'wrist'),]
            ```
            Here 'accel' and 'wrist' are defined in modality and location metadata files, but in general the
            intersection of the key (a tuple of strings) and the elements of feats are compared. When the size of
            the intersection matches the length of the elements of feat, this element is added.


        Returns
        -------
